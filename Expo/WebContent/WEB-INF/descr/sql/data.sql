With Design Patterns, you get to take advantage of the best practices and experience of others, so that you can spend your time on...something else. Something more challenging. Something more complex. Something more fun. You want to learn about the patterns that matter--why to use them, when to use them, how to use them (and when NOT to use them). But you don''t just want to see how patterns look in a book, you want to know how they look in the wild. In their native environment. In other words, in real world applications. You also want to learn how patterns are used in the Java API, and how to exploit Java''s built-in pattern support in your own code. You want to learn the real OO design principles and why everything your boss told you about inheritance might be wrong (and what to do instead). You want to learn how those principles will help the next time you''re up a creek without a design paddle pattern. Most importantly, you want to learn the secret language of Design Patterns so that you can hold your own with your co-worker (and impress cocktail party guests) when he casually mentions his stunningly clever use of Command, Facade, Proxy, and Factory in between sips of a martini. You''ll easily counter with your deep understanding of why Singleton isn''t as simple as it sounds, how the Factory is so often misunderstood, or on the real relationship between Decorator, Facade and Adapter. With Head First Design Patterns, you''ll avoid the embarrassment of thinking Decorator is something from the Trading Spaces show. Best of all, in a way that won''t put you to sleep!

If you''ve read a Head First book, you know what to expect--a visually-rich format designed for the way your brain works.

In the early 17th century, a small group of devout English Christians fled their villages to escape persecution, going first to Holland, then making the now infamous 10-week voyage to the New World. Rather than arriving in the summer months as planned, they landed in November, low on supplies. Luckily, they were met by the Wampanoag Indians and their wizened chief, Massasoit. In economical, well-paced prose, Philbrick masterfully recounts the desperate circumstances of both the settlers and their would-be hosts, and how the Wampanoags saved the colony from certain destruction. Indeed, there was a first Thanksgiving, the author notes, and for over 50 years the Wampanoags and the Pilgrims lived in peace, becoming increasingly interdependent. But in 1675, 56 years after the colonists'' landing, Massasoit''s heir, Philip, launched a confusing war on the English that, over 14 horrifying months, claimed 5,000 lives, a huge percentage of the colonies'' population. Impeccably researched and expertly rendered, Philbrick''s account brings the Plymouth Colony and its leaders, including William Bradford, Benjamin Church and the bellicose, dwarfish Miles Standish, vividly to life. More importantly, he brings into focus a gruesome period in early American history.

Each chapter starts out with an example of what Dan refers to as an \93unbulletproof\94 concept\97an existing site that employs a traditional approach and its associated pitfalls. Dan then deconstructs that approach, noting its downsides and then making the site over using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). By the end of each chapter, you\92ll have replaced traditional, bloated, inaccessible page components with lean markup and CSS. The guide culminates with a chapter that pieces together all of the page components discussed in prior chapters into a single page template. \n', 'Bulletproof Web Design: Improving flexibility and protecting against worst-case scenarios with XHTML and CSS', 62.3, 'upload/ent1/1/0321346939.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_.jpg', 0, 'upload/ent1/1/0321346939.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V1121469626_.jpg', 'English', '2005', '652', 11.4, 12);

Larson tells the stories of two men: Daniel H. Burnham, the architect responsible for the fair''s construction, and H.H. Holmes, a serial killer masquerading as a charming doctor. Burnham''s challenge was immense. In a short period of time, he was forced to overcome the death of his partner and numerous other obstacles to construct the famous White City around which the fair was built. His efforts to complete the project, and the fair''s incredible success, are skillfully related along with entertaining appearances by such notables as Buffalo Bill Cody, Susan B. Anthony, and Thomas Edison. The activities of the sinister Dr. Holmes, who is believed to be responsible for scores of murders around the time of the fair, are equally remarkable. He devised and erected the World''s Fair Hotel, complete with crematorium and gas chamber, near the fairgrounds and used the event as well as his own charismatic personality to lure victims.

Eaton had to abandon Hamet and was in turn virtually abandoned by the Jefferson administration, leaving him with a mountain of debt and a drinking problem that eventually killed him at 47. There has been a dearth of good material on the Barbary War and particularly on Eaton''s trek; Zacks has researched thoroughly, writes entertainingly and shows a knack for sea stories and characterization.

Phillips (American Dynasty) expounds upon historical parallels for each of his three subjects. In his section on Oil and American Supremacy, for example, he points to Britain''s post-WWI involvement in the Middle East as an analogy to Iraq, and in his section on radicalized religion, he warns of the pitfalls of imperial Christian overreach from Rome to Britain. The five major measures of U.S. debt\97from national to household\97keep setting records, he observes in his section on Borrowed Prosperity, and the real estate boom spurred by the Federal Reserve, he argues, cannot continue. Phillips identifies the escalating clout of the financial services industry and suggests that Americans should emulate policies in Asia that encourage savings and in Europe that encourage manufacturing. The lesson of the past, he warns, is that intractable national issues generate weak and compromising politicians or zealous bumblers.

In a remarkably accessible, even breezy style, she looks at these issues in light of recent history both abroad and at home, from the religious fundamentalism that led to the ouster of the shah of Iran to the invasion of Iraq and American hope that a political culture can emerge there that integrates democracy and Islam. But Albright also looks critically at President Bush, an evangelical Christian who invokes God in the name of fighting evil. In this ambitious, thoughtful, and wide-ranging treatment, Albright deftly balances the pragmatic need to confront religious-based unrest and the idealistic need to temper one''s own personal beliefs in the public realm. While fully acknowledging the threat al- Qaeda poses, Albright rejects the notion that a clash of civilizations is in progress and wisely calls for care and nuance in how America approaches international confrontations that are tinged with religion.', 'The Mighty and the Almighty: Reflections on America, God, and World Affairs ', 25.3, 'upload/ent1/1/0060892579.01._AA240_SCLZZZZZZZ_V54588806_.jpg', 0, 'upload/ent1/1/0060892579.01._SS500_SCLZZZZZZZ_V54588806_.jpg', 'English', '2006', '236', 11.2, 24);

In this ground-breaking book Melanie Phillips pieces together the story of how Londonistan developed as a result of the collapse of traditional British identity and accommodation of a particularly virulent form of multiculturalism.

Well, I got that understanding. And I got a lot more, not the least are vital insights as to just how very different Europe is from the US. The author is both a clear writer, and an excellent journalist who digs down into the entrails to bring forth the real guts of a story. The information he brilliantly provided often left me with my jaw hanging, wondering, That''s really what they think over there? I learned an awful lot in the short time it took to read this book. \n\nI honestly think that every American should read it. It is a clarion call to not repeat the myopic, multicultural mistakes that have gotten European countries into a fix that I honestly don''t see how they can get out of now. You will acquire a clear portrait of the attitudes of Muslims in Europe, as well as those of elitist Europeans in all of their moral smugness and self-assuming superiority. Many themes are presented, but perhaps the over-arching theme is that tolerance for the intolerable (wife beating, genital mutilation, honor killing, rape, etc.) is never ever a good policy for a freedom loving, individual-respecting society. \n\nWhile Europe Slept makes a highly readable contribution to the discussion on the impact of Mideastern Islam with the democractic West. It also has a lot to say about the role that the United States has played in this drama. It turns out that we are not nearly as bad as those who claim to hate us say we are. Reading this book had the unsuspected effect of leaving me feeling even more blessed and happy that I am one of those lucky ones to be an American.

(When it''s a movie based on a book, I do it the other way around.) Superman is my favorite comic book hero of all time, and I dearly loved the movie. Although I was disappointed with Wolfman''s previous novel, an adaptation of his own Crisis on Infinite Earths, I wanted to give him another shot. I''m glad to say this is a far better effort than the Crisis novel. Perhaps because the scope of this story is smaller, with a smaller cast of characters and none of the time travel hullaballoo to deal with, Wolfman manages to give us an adaptation that does just what you want a novelization to do: gives you the basic story of the film while filling in gaps, explaining more of the characters'' motivation and history and throwing out occasional Easter Eggs for fans of the comics or earlier adaptations of the character. \n\nLike you see with novelizations sometimes, though, there are a few discreprencies between the film and the book, including a fairly major plot point towards the end which is done away with in the novel. When this happens, particularly in the case of such an important element, it''s usually the case of the filmmakers adding something in too late for the novelist to include the change. You can''t really fault Wolfman for it, but at the same time, it still makes the book a little less satisfying to read as an adaptation. Still, it''s a fun book based on a fantastic movie, and I''m glad I gave Wolfman another chance.\n', '2006-07-01 00:00:00', 6);

Based on Chris'' theory that has been evolving since October of 2004 when he published it first in Wired magazine, this is a culmination of his ideas and contributions from many people on the internet (he has developed part of the ideas in open source format on the web). \n\nIn summary the idea of the book is that in internet world, shelf space is unlimited and due to this fact an interesting phenomenon emerges that breaks the intuition around 80/20 rule. Since shelf space is essentially free, if unlimited number of items are kept in virtual shelf and if those items even sell one unit, due to large number of such ''non hit'' items, total revenue from ''non hits'' will rival those of ''hits''. Therefore in the age of plenty (e.g. plenty of virtual shelf space) ''non hits'' become as important and ''hit'' products. \n\nDetails and implications of the above idea is covered throughout the book.

In our current post-modern culture, choice is everything because experience is everything. And, peer recommendation is everything because believing other people''s stories (their narrative of their experience) is everything. \n\nThis rather pedantic sociological analysis aside, Anderson''s subtitle explains well his premise: Why the Future of Business Is Selling Less of More. Or, as one wag cutely and curtly summarizes, niches are riches. In other words, not everyone can be rich and famous. However, with the explosion of technology, everyone can find their passion and promote it successfully to a livable extent. \n\nOf course, in some ways this is not much different from ancient modernity. For instance, it has long been the practice in publishing that the top few authors receive the vast majority of promotion from publishers. The only difference now is that the starving author or artist might actually find enough takers to feed her or his family. \n\nWhat''s the take home for the average Jane or Joe entrepreneur? Location, location, location. That is, get the message about your message (be it a book, a song, a new business, etc.) out to the right people. And who are the right people?--your target audience. Know who wants your message and know how to reach them. And, know how to encourage them to tell their friends about your product. Word of mouth truly does work in post-modern niche marketing. Forget spending the big bucks on professional marketing--leave that to the big boys. Save your money by focusing on the pass it on principle--one satisfied customer telling other hungry potential customers about what you have to offer. \n\nBack to Anderson, he takes this rather simple message and both creatively and statistically relates it to our current culture. Of course, he is the head of the long tail, but the rest of us at least can find hope to be somehow connected to the body. \n\nReviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Soul Physicians, Spiritual Friends, and the forthcoming Beyond the Suffering. \n\n', '2006-07-09 00:00:00', 7);

Similar to his previous books, he effectively uses a broad array of real-life examples (e.g. the NYPD, a church, the Girl Scouts, the Cleveland Orchestra, a high school science dept), helpful graphics, and a very readable, conversational tone. Even though the monograph is only 31 pages, Collins contributes his clear thinking on numerous issues that will be very familiar to social sector leaders: how to measure success in non-$ metrics, how to recruit and motivate a passionate (and poorly-paid or unpaid) staff, how to think differently about restricted funds, and how to transcend systemic / external / industry-wide problems.

You''ll probably be thinking it''s one of four characters right up until the last few pages. \n\nThe most delightful aspect of this well-written story is that Ms. Roberts doesn''t rush her story, her characters or your pleasure in enjoying the book.

The is the violent pole of our history of genocide and manifest destiny. This is where the right wing of American History gets its impetus. The other wing is more humane: the benign treatment and early alliance with some of the American Indian tribes. This represents the Liberal wing of American history which expresses itsself in seeking the welfare and community of all. Both impetus have been with America since these early days. The darkness of genocide, war and slavery versus the light of peaceful trade and cultural interchange. \nThe most touching scene for me was the story of the Mayflower colonist scraping the tongue of the Indian leader, hand feeding him and saving his life.

Yes, I know many have praised the book and I admit it is fascinating reading and fairly well written: that is, if it is all true, which I sincerely doubt. At the outset, let me say I am not a supporter of this president. As a deacon in the Roman Catholic Church, I challenge his interpretation of Christian faith and understanding of moral theology and social responsibiity. He seems to forget that Christ said, Blessed are the peacemakers for they are the geniuine children of God and Christians have a God-given obligation to social justice and the downtrodden within society. Sometimes I think he believes that competitive free market excesses (Radical Capitalism) has a legitimate place in Christian Systematic Theology. Even so, you would think I found the book educational, particulary since I am fond of Ron Suskind and praised his other books.. But, I did not! No author worth his salt would ask a reader to trust his version of history without citing a single reference, especially when he quotes other people profusely and writes as if were witness to events and conversations, which he was not. Can you trust any politician or federal employee who refuses to go on the record? No - - thatis why most reporters ignore them. It is noteworthy that historical scholars have alread called this emmission unworthy a Pulitzer Prize Winner and a reason why the book will never become part of academia or any factual history of the War on Terror. Nevertheless, am I to trust his account simply because he says so. Well, pardon me, but I am not that gullible or desperate for so-called insider information, which in this White House is an oxymoron. No Bush insider gives out anything but disinformation designed to spin the facts. What else disturbs me about this book? The author appears to peek into the president''s persona, but in fact he colors what the public knows are the his real characteristics. He pretends to be against many facets of the so-called War on Terror, but in fact he excuses its excesses while glamorizing the participants as either over-worked and misunderstood men and women or people we should excuse because this type of war is new territory. He tries to explain the war as a mixture of inexcusable machoism and bureaucratic error while he lets the president off the hook by painting him as an innocent, misunderstood bystander - - what he calls a victim of events out of his control. He spends a lot of time on the so-called unadvertised victoriers of the war (about half the book) and in the end does more toexcuse the president by using the presidents favorite defense mechanism: namely, the blame game. It wasn''t Bush''s fault, it was everybody else''s around him. When I stood back and weighed the overhall impact of the book, I came away even more suspicious. Some inexcusable attitudes and mistakes are recorded, but people will get the idea that Bush is not so bad after all, when he has been one of the worst Chief Executives in history in my opinion. The book reminds me of icing on a cardbaord cake; only in this instance the White House is aptly described as having little real substance below the surface - - yet, the fancy icing remains. Why? There is something seriously wrong with this book. Maybe others will eventuall do a better job of defining what''s wrong than I have done. However, one thing is clear to me, Ron Suskind could never have written this book without the White House''s blessing, which it would not give. What is wrong with this picture? He had to be privy to some type of information to write it. To date, the White House has been stangely silent about the work - - a get-out-of-jail-free- card not given previously to any author or critic. Something''s fishy, here folks. I have the feeling the public is being duped. If I am wrong, forgive me. But a lot of my feelings are Suskind''s fault by the way he chose to write the book. Since I like the man and his previous books, I trust he takes my critique constructively. If his account is true, then he should have written it differently. heart.', '2003-02-04 00:00:00', 17);

Many of these sellers dump their money into schemes involving middlemen masquerading as wholesalers, drop-shippers who don''t really have the advertised product, or for some get-rich-quick book promising a magic bullet to making big money selling online. \n\nThe author also dispels the myth that sellers should sell what they know and what they''re passionate about. Instead, the author explains that if you really want to build a business, you must find out *what buyers want* and how you can get it for them at the best price. And this book explains exactly how to do it. \n\nThis book exposes many fraudulent eBay get-rich-quick schemes, concluding: A real eBay business takes time, commitment to learning, and a good deal of hard work to build. Truer words have never been said, and they apply to entrepreneurship everywhere, not just eBay. So people hoping to crack some secret code and make a ton of cash without hard work will be sorely disappointed with this book (or any other realistic book). \n\nThis book is intended for online sellers who want to build a business that can be scaled larger over time by selling new merchandise in quantity. It''s not intended for those who want to sell only collectibles or one-off used products. The premise is that new, standardized goods obtained in quantity can be sold faster and in higher volume, compared to unique collectibles, where a tremendous amount of effort is expended in finding each item, not to mention the labor involved in listing them for sale, researching and describing each one accurately, taking photos, etc. So while your profit margin may be lower with new merchandise, you can more than make up for it with volume -- if you know what you''re doing. \n\nThis book explains why it''s best to focus on selling in a niche and how to discover a niche you can concentrate on. It explains how to find products people want, and how to get them at the lowest price. This book contains numerous tips on finding legitimate wholesaler suppliers, and a comprehensive discussion of how the wholesale industry works and how to build long-term product sourcing relationships. \n\nIn the chapter about finding wholesalers, the author explains why *real* wholesalers don''t advertise in search engines, and why the *fake* wholesalers do. This is must-have information for someone who is looking to expand their business, but doesn''t have a thorough background in the wholesaling industry. \n\nFor eBay sellers in particular, this book warns against three dreaded parasites that consistently rip off new sellers: Product sourcing middlemen, product-sourcing multi-level marketers, and junk product sourcing information. Middlemen try to trick you into thinking they''re a wholesaler, but they''re really a retailer who will take a big cut from your profit margin. After reading this book, you''ll be able to spot the frauds a mile away. Successful sellers work with real wholesalers who work *directly* with product manufacturers. ', '2006-03-12 00:00:00', 31);

If you''ve barely scratched the surface of the subject, it''s tempting to think that SOA is just Web services. Even Notes/Domino 7 has hopped on that bandwagon with new design elements to support Web services. However, in reality, SOA is far, far more. If you want (or need) to understand the subject well, I''d recommend Service-Oriented Architecture - Concepts, Technology, and Design by Thomas Erl. The 792-page book may look intimidating, but don''t let the size scare you off... \n\nErl''s book is broken up into five parts that help you get your mind around what can be a large and complex subject. Part 1 concentrates on the higher-level fundamentals, such as what SOA is (and isn''t), the history of SOA, and how we currently use SOA with the Web services framework. Then, Part 2 gets into the newer standards for Web services, commonly referred to as the WS-* extensions. These standards are still evolving and morphing, but you''ll understand where the industry is headed. Parts 3 and 4 delve into the concept of services and describe how to design your system to best leverage that architecture. Without this knowledge, you might end up with various Web services that really don''t constitute a true SOA system. In Part 5, you get into the actual XML file layouts of each SOA component, so that you can understand the internals and how all the components work together. \n\nI most appreciated the book''s focus on explaining things using case studies and analogies. The case studies run through the entire book, so you can see how a company might evolve their strategy over time. Especially helpful are the analogies (In Plain English), in that they point out how a service-oriented structure exists in many of the things we do in everyday life. We just don''t think of them that way. You''ll learn how the author''s car washing enterprise parallels an SOA design, and this comparison does wonders for making it all come together. \n\nOne thing the book does not do is get into platform-specific implementation details. Towards the end of the book, there is coverage on .Net and J2EE implementations of SOA, but not at a level that would allow you to sit down and start coding.

Bristling at the constant reminder of New York City''s superiority in so many areas, Chicago''s city fathers rallied the troops and went all out in proving to New Yorkers, to the nation and to the world that Chicago was equal to the great challenge of mounting a World Exposition of truly monumental stature. Larson''s descriptions of the Herculean effort put forth by numerous architects, builders, politicians, etc. lead the reader to a true appreciation of these can do, spirited individuals.\nYet beneath the teeming activity and a short distance away from the gleaming white Pleasure Palaces of the Fair, there stood a building of a different sort entirely, inhabited by one of the most vicious, truly evil creatures the young nation ever produced. Larson does an adequate, but not great job of telling the darker story surrounding H H Holmes, the mesmeric Svengali whose brilliant blue eyes and engaging charm seduced at least a score (one estimate was up to 200, which the author disputes) unfortunate women. Unlike Jack the Ripper, to whom he was later likened, he didn''t limit himself to female victims. Business partners who had outworn their usefulness and several children were amongst his prey, as well. He just had a penchant for murder. \n\nThe sections on the construction of the Columbia Exposition are filled with fascinating anecdotes, ranging from the origins of the sobriquet windy city (derisively coined by Charles Anderson Dana, Editor of The New York Sun) to the dramatic entrance of Annie Oakley, barreling in on horseback and blazing away with her two six-shooters in Buffalo Bill Cody''s Western Show adjacent to the Fair Grounds. Larson also provides an interesting side story surrounding Patrick Predergast, a delusional political aspirant who turns assassin. He paints a compelling portrait of Fredrick Law Olmstead, American History''s premier landscape architect who took up the almost impossible task of designing and overseeing the Exposition''s parks and lagoons. The hero of the book, however, is Daniel Hudson Burnham, who was ultimately responsible for the lion''s share of the planning, construction and smooth running of the entire enterprise. He had a little over two years from the time Congress selected Chicago from a list of candidate cities that included Saint Louis and New York, to the day of the Expo''s official opening. That he got the job done within the alloted time is one of the great marvels in an age of marvels, especially given the myriad difficulties which he and his crew had to overcome. \n\nThe Holmes narractive appears a bit lackluster in comparison to the story of the Fair''s construction. Larson acknowledges the difficulty he faced in recreating Holmes'' vicious crimes via imaginary vignettes. He states in an afterword that he went back and read Capote''s IN COLD BLOOD for the technique in which Capote so brilliantly engaged in his imaginative reconstruction of events. The only problem with this approach is that Capote had access to and the confidence of the two killers that are at the center of IN COLD BLOOD. Larson had only newspaper accounts from the period as well as a very unreliable journal that Holmes wrote after he was tried and sentenced to death (he was hanged several months after the trial). It would appear that Larson goes a bit too far out of his way to avoid the lurid and sensationalitic aspects of Holmes'' killing spree. One has only to visit some of the numerous web sites devoted to Holmes to see that Larson is particularly reticent to discuss Holmes'' sexual deviance. This is understandable, as Larson wants to be taken seriously as an historian, yet the facts are out there (most of them well documented) so it wouldn''t have hurt to have included a bit more of the darker details. The book could also have used more illustrations. The Chicago Tribune, at the time the story first broke in 1894, included a detailed floor plan of the Chamber of Horrors Holmes built on the corner of Sixty-Third and Wallace in the Englewood section of Chicago. That illustration would have given the reader a better sense of the bizarre layout of the structure. More pictures of the Exposition would have also been helpful.

The Scarlet Letter is not to be (nor is it possible to be) read lightly; it is actually, in the way of many 19th-century classic novels, quite painful to read. I loved it, and I still trudged through it. \n\nThe subject matter, infinitely grim and distasteful, is not enjoyable in any way. It centers on the nature of morality, sin, corruption, hypocrisy especially concerning morality, and all that hackneyed bag of themes. You probably already know the general plot of the novel, so I need not reiterate it. Ironically, while criticizing the hypocrisy and sternness of the Puritans, Hawthorne seems very puritannical himself, and displays those same characteristics, including a kind of absurd self-righteousness and a pompous, austere, rigid, very Christian sense of morality. I got endless irony out of this; it seemed as though he, as the narrator, was condemning the Puritans for their harsh, hypocritical actions while endorsing Puritan principles and expressing views just as severe and ridiculously religious, if not more so, than theirs. I have to warn you that it''s pretty disgusting the way he is wholly obsessed with the ideas of sin and guilt. Honestly, I think all he wrote about in his lifetime were Puritans, morality, sin and how we are all horrible sinners, etc. I imagine he could have been a fire-and-brimstone-preaching evangelist if he hadn''t chosen the path of literary genius instead. And yes, despite all this, he is still a literary genius. \n\nWhat makes this such a wonderful piece of classic literature, and one of my favorites, is how beautiful, eloquent, gorgeous, and sophisticated the language is. Rarely have I seen such an astounding mastery of the English language and literary devices, with perfect fluency and coherence, depth, insight, passion, intensity, and power of expression. Of course, I''m sure the style of prose is not for everyone; but I find it remarkable, magnificent, admirable. I loved the rampant symbolism, the ingenuity of little metaphors found everywhere. I loved the character Pearl, who is so strange and otherwordly and complex. Dimmesdale is, well, so very pathetic; he is the epitome of the once-righteous-now-fallen, guilt-torn, utterly miserable, wretched, squirming, feeble, tortured soul, and his abject, wallowing despair adds to the overall gloomy and tormenting atmosphere of the novel. \n\nI know I ranted quite a bit in this review, but honestly, it''s a superb work and triumph of English-language literature, and you should at least be able to appreciate it to some degree, in some aspects, and concede its exceptional use of language. I have a feeling that a lot of the reviewers expressing negative opinions are malcontent high school students grumbling about a stupid, boring book assigned to them for class. I myself had to read it for my junior-year English class, but I am very glad I was forced to do so. \n\nFor those whining about how verbose it is - please get over your own short attention span or lack of taste or whatever it is that impedes you from recognizing and appreciating good literature. An example of verbosity is: I waded along the flooded bank of the river that had overflowed its banks and along which I now waded in flood water, not a sentence of graceful structure and expressiveness like (randomly selecting): Continually, indeed, as it stole onward, the streamlet kept up a babble, kind, quiet, soothing, but melancholy, like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness, and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintances and events of sombre hue. \n\n', '2006-02-17 00:00:00', 38);

There is plenty of space for both foundational and later literature. \n\nBut looking at the list of books selected, I am appalled. Other reviewers have noted the high number of contemporary books, many of which are unlikely to pass the test of time. But some of the omissions are, frankly, appalling. The core of Western literature, without which a reader is much limited in their ability to understand later writing, is missing. How can the Iliad and Odyssey not be books one should read before one dies? Aithiopika, but not the Aeneid? Not Oedipus Rex, Antigone, or indeed a single Greek play? Not Plato''s Republic? Not Chaucer''s Canterbury Tales? Not Milton''s Paradise Lost? The Little Prince, but not The Divine Comedy? And not a single work of Shakespeare? And not the single work which has affected later literature more than any other work ever written -- the Bible? \n\nI do not worship the classical canon at the expense of later writing. But to suggest that it is more valuable before one dies to have read Dining on Stones than to have read King Lear is doing a very serious disservice to prospective readers who may indeed be wondering what books it will benefit them to have read at some point during their lifetimes. Steering those readers away from the foundational works of Western literature into a bath of modern novels is not only irresponsible but downright cruel. \n\nReaders who seriously want to know what they should read before they die would be much better with Clifton Fadiman''s Lifetime Reading Plan. That is the best single source I know of the true books that one really should read before one dies.

Not that this book is missing her typically astute writing, just that it''s brief, almost more of an extended essay than an in-depth look at the subject. \n\nArmstrong follows the development of myth from prehistoric times to the present. Myth, as she describes it, is a fundamental part of human development, and similar stories can be found from culture to culture. The use of myth is a way for people to connect with the unseen forces of the universe. In the earliest days (the era of the hunter-gatherers), everything seemed to be imbued with this supernatural force: rocks, animals and the sky. With the development of agriculture and civilization, new myths developed and eventually, there would be a rebellion against myth. \n\nIn fact the concluding portion of the book revisits the ideas Armstrong presented in greater detail in The Battle for God. Namely, when there is a conflict between myth and reason, a backlash will occur (taking the form of what we would consider fundamentalism). \n\nAs with other books of Armstrong''s that I have read, this is written with a sophisticated audience in mind and will not be an easy read for everyone. In addition, the more religiously orthodox may be offended by some of her writing, which treats the stories of the monotheistic faiths as mythical as the tales of Zeus or Odin.

The periodization of the book focuses on the data of the Axial Age, which the author threatens to turn into another myth. Armstrong''s treatment of this subject has made it into a proxy for the onset of the world reiligions, when in fact the Axial Age is something far more complex than that. The rise of Greek science, the emergence of the world''s first democracy and much, much else have a place in the consideration of the Axial period. Correctly understanding this period is not so simple and there is a danger that the author''s power to sell books and bestsellers will completely confuse this issue for large numbers of people, making the whole area suspect.

Then, of course, he defies your comprehension and makes it worse again, and then again. Koontz does escalating tension and events better than anyone, and does it with such deceptively simple writing that his stories feel like terrifying roller-coaster rides: the hair curling build-up of tension, the shrieking plunge into depths of despair and hopelessness, then the shocking, violent twists and turns, and finally, heart-pounding and breast heaving, you safely glide to a controlled stop and the safe normal world you are accustomed to can resume again. \n\nIn The Husband, a simple gardener is interrupted while working by a cell call.

Lee Child is at his best when spinning a good mystery for Reacher to solve, and nagging incongruities surrounding the kidnapping of Lane''s wife and daughter provide the perfect backdrop for Child to practice his craft. The Hard Way''s Reacher is a bit wiser, more mature, using more brain and less brawn. More Sherlock Holmes and less Rambo this time around. In fact, more than 300 pages have turned before Reacher actually hurts someone, but the Child layers the tension and drops hints masterfully, leading up to a climax that will have you sweating right through your Barcalounger. The author''s patented lean and no-nonsense prose is in top form, but what makes Child so readable are the obscure little bits of knowledge and factoids tucked away in cracks and corners of the plot, adding enough depth and authenticity to give the larger-than-life Reacher credibility that sets him apart from the just plain silly superheroes of so many thrillers of the day. \n\nSo to wrap it up, The Hard Way is about as good as it gets - intelligent, clever, a .50 caliber pressure tank tale that twists and turns and jumps from Greenwich Village to Africa''s west coast - of bad guys doing bad things and paying the price to an avenging angel in the form Jack Reacher.

Everything in her life is exaggerated in typical Kinsella style: Her family blows off her birthday, she can''t picture a vacuum cleaner bag, she works All The Time. \n\nThen, she apparently makes a major mistake. When she realizes its ramifications, she freaks out and flees blindly to the countryside. Then, in typically whacky Kinsella style, she becomes a housekeeper to a nouveau-riche couple. \n\nOf course, she learns to do the job well, sneakily handles some legal work for her boss, falls in love, relaxes, becomes more beautiful, and exposes some major corruption back in London. \n\nEven if you like this syrupy and silly kind of story, there are some major issues with the premise. Why is it that working women are so often portrayed as colorless, unhappy and unfulfilled? The message that giving up your career for a country life of bread-baking, that just seems to be an old-fashioned, even anti-woman message. I don''t want to spoil the fun of the book, but that''s a pretty major problem. \n\nI also thought Kinsella missed a chance to tie up a lot of loose ends. Even if she''d added a Six Months Later final chapter, she could have told us what happened to her nouveau riche couple''s legal tangles, if the lady of the house found a fulfilling volunteer opporunity, and many other tidbits. \n\nKinsella is a delightful writer. Her characters are loopy and self-effacing, if over-the-top. If you can get past the silliness, and the troubling anti-working-woman premise of the plot, this is a funny, joyful read.

Ever since the end of the Donovan family books, I have not enjoyed her writing. In this book, the characters are hard to relate to, and the plot is confusing. The reader receives very little background on the characters, and Lowell jumps right into the action. The beginning plot of the story shows promise, when the reader learns that the main character, Grace, discovers that her son is being held hostage in Mexico and she must consult someone from her past (Joe) to help her save her son. There is no spark between Grace and Joe. The great flirty sexy banter and sexual tension that Lowell does so well is absent in this book. I just never bought into their relationship, and I couldn''t feel myself in the book. The plot is also very complicated. Grace and Joe make many trips between the U.S. and Mexico, negotiating with various Mexican gangs and leaders.

He was a law-giver who essentially outlawed the culture he came from--transforming it from a Scots-like clan of cattle rustlers and raiders, to a monolithic, highly disciplined cavalry of conquerers. He devised entirely new military tactics that were as successful against the cities of the Chinese as against the armored knights of the West. And they started out as a people, he claims, who did not even know how to weave cloth!\nWeatherford here takes up the challenge of accenting the positive impact of his brutal conquests. Among other things he makes the case for his setting the West up for the Renaissance, the introduction of paper money, the postal system, Religious tolerance, and new vegetables. He bases much of this on new scholarship, rather than the hysterical propaganda of the aristocrats whom he threatened. Partly based on the mysterious Secret History of the Mongols, the author''s own travels in Mongolia, and contacts with Mongolian revivalists, he makes this bit of history accessible even to the most prejudiced reader.\n\nStrangely omitted, though, is the fascinating tale that the geneticists have discovered about his Y chromosome, which appears to show that he might just have been the most prolific lover in the last couple of millennia! Too recent, maybe.\n\nOne of the remarkable features of his style was that he hated the elite and the aristocrats, and slaughtered as many as he could. He loved the professional men, the teachers and doctors, and especially the craftsmen and engineers, and did not even tax them. My kinda guy!\n\nWeatherford''s style of writing is lively and easy to read. The maps are just detailed enough to be informative without overburdening the reader in detail.

And I especially enjoyed his description of the military tactics employed by the cavalry, and his use of siege engines and gunpowder, which would be new to most readers. \n\nPerhaps one of his greatest inventions, though, is that of diplomatic immunity. Any city, and there were several, who murdered or mutilated his envoys as a method of rejecting his terms of surrender, would be ruthlessly razed and the inhabitants slaughtered.

The narrative he left behind is replete with oracular insights that have supplied fodder for centuries of academic lectures: The evils inflicted by the gods ought to be borne with patient resignation and the evils inflicted by enemies with manly fortitude. No state can possibly preserve itself free unless it be a match for neighboring powers. For so remarkably perverse is the nature of man that he despises whoever courts him and admires whoever will not bend before him. Proverbial nuggets like these, at once both prescient and commonsensical, threaten to upstage all the carnage of that war.\nThese axioms, of course, come courtesy of Thucydides, the Athenian historian who (one would have thought) wrote the last word on the struggle. The Peloponnesian War -- that chain of bloody campaigns between the Athenians and the Spartans that gripped mainland Greece and beyond between 431 and 404 B.C. and seemed to risk destroying for all time so much that we think of as uniquely Greek, such as philosophical dialogues, wine parties and democracy -- bequeathed myriad benefits to students of history, not the least of which are those time-honored tips on both strategy and prudence. But time has sanitized the war for us. Only with effort do we see that this war arose not from the mist of Homeric legend but from the smoke of real battlefields where real men -- and not a few women and children -- were butchered with methods ever more malevolent and efficient. Massacre moved in those days from an art form to a science. If history ever gave us a war to end all wars, this should have been the one.\n\nA War Like No Other can be read as an elaborate excursus on the work of Thucydides, performed by Victor Davis Hanson, a former professor of classics who has made himself one of our premier military historians. Hanson might fairly be accused of overproduction -- still in his prime, he has authored or co-authored 15 other books -- but this study demonstrates the care of an avid, meticulous scholar whose learning can be worn lightly because it''s so assured. He has also become a formidable journalist in recent years, which has prompted him to produce prose that is starkly appealing, direct and accessible to the common, curious reader. \n\nHanson chronicles the thousands of ordinary Greeks who were slaughtered for nearly three decades for the designs of fickle men, shifting alliances, and contradictory causes, and he explores the methods used to conduct the war over time, which makes the book not only a rapid read but also a handy reference for browsing. Hanson is at his best when wielding details (the widths of various pieces of armor, for instance). He economically traces the roots of enmity between Athens and Sparta reaching back at least 50 years before hostilities commenced in the days of Pericles, the legendary Athenian leader. We discover how land forces complemented or competed with trireme ships, how hoplites (heavily armored infantrymen) were used and ill-used, how craftily built walls led to the siege war that helped to draw out the conflict for almost 30 years. He is especially sound on the role of raw terror in war -- the festering fear of noncombatants as well as the heart-stopping fright experienced by those on the battlefront. He examines the Great Plague of 430 and shows how its debilitating effects cropped up in the literature of subsequent times. In other words, he gives us the context that Thucydides could not.\n\nBy the time we get to the shank end of the war, with the Athenian debacle on Sicily between 415 and 413 -- painful reading, whether in Thucydides or Hanson -- we have trudged a long way in the footsteps of cruel, unforgiving armies and their leaders, men like Alcibiades, Nicias, Gylippus, Cleon and Lysander. In the end, Hanson''s is not a rosy view of the glory that was Greece; instead, he has produced a searing look at the creative talent for killing that marked the Greeks at their bravest and most heartless. After wading through the swamp of such devastation, one yearns for a sip of wine and a spot of Plato to redeem these people. \n\nHanson performs the difficult feat of not talking down to readers while still presuming no prior knowledge of the war. Although an understanding of Greek history of the 5th and 4th centuries B.C. will certainly quicken one''s pace, Hanson provides helpful appendices for the uninitiated or the rusty, identifying key terms, places and characters. His copious notes, written to inform and not to impress, will also fill in many gaps. \n\n', '2005-06-29 00:00:00', 53);

This book will satisfy all three crowds. To find accurate history written in such an engaging, page-turning manner is a rare delight. \n\nThe United States became a nation at a time when the Barbary States (Tripoli, Tunis and Algiers) were enjoying a piracy trade they had been running for three centuries. This robbery took place by forcefully taking a ship on the high seas, then keeping the goods and enslaving the crew and passengers. The pirates would hold prisoners for ransom--typically for a year, while they negotiated a price--then release them when paid. No country would stand up to these pirates. In fact, other nations paid tribute to them to avert even worse problems. \n\nThis cowardly state of affairs would have continued for centuries more, had not William Eaton headed up a mission to end the reign of one of the bashaws (a bashaw is a sort of king). \n\nThis particular bashaw (Yussef) killed his oldest brother, who had been the rightful heir to the throne. Then, he took the middle brother''s family hostage and sent him into exile--leaving Yussef the one occupying the throne. The middle brother, Hamet, wanted to regain his throne from his sadistic and unscrupulous younger brother. This is where William Eaton came in. \n\nTo understand the central story, you have to understand Eaton. Zacks helps us do this, by showing Eaton engaging in the failures that brought him to the point where his adventure with Hamet began. Eaton had a sound military mind, but he was lousy at politics. He was constantly shooting himself in the proverbial foot, and his enemies took pains to make him suffer. \n\nEaton''s adventure with Hamet is the central story of this book. How that adventure begins, stumbles, picks up, and goes through a multitude of setbacks and political machinations is fascinating. How it ends is disheartening, because that ending shows the triumph of petty politics over common sense. \nThis book allows the reader to see into historical events and the people behind them. For example: \n\nWe see the pompous Tobias Lear--a long-time personal friend of George Washington who damaged that relationship by stealing rent money he was allegedly collecting for Washington--truly bungle negotiations in a way that makes you think of Jimmy Carter. He was that bad. \n\nWe see the incompetent Captain William Bainbridge surrender the USS Philadelphia, when there was no reason to do so. This act of stupidity wasn''t his first surrender. But, this one got his whole crew enslaved (and some killed) and tortured for over a year. Officers, of course, were pampered by their hosts (only the enlisted men were barbarized). Amazingly, the Navy gave him command of yet another ship. I guess three''s a charm? \n\nWe see Thomas Jefferson get an object lesson in why a gunboat navy doesn''t work and why a navy needs massive ships. Jefferson was a complex character and a skillful political manipulator. Zacks shows the man at his scheming best, while also reminding us of Jefferson''s many significant contributions. A balanced portrayal like this rarely occurs in accounts of major historical figures. \n\nToday, we think of the US Marines as an elite force--the few and the proud. They are often the first into battle. But at the start of Eaton''s adventure, they were not highly thought of. Their pay was less than that of a regular sailor, and their main job was to serve as a sort of police force for the ship they were assigned to. \n\nBut Eaton took a force of Marines into battle and made history. Eaton''s Marines did what Marines have done ever since--the impossible. \n\nThroughout this book, you can''t help but share Eaton''s sense of frustration as he faces one obstacle after another. Because the dialogue and narration are so alive, you experience his joys, his anger, his pride, and his worry. Zacks does an excellent job of bringing those emotions forth. But Zack stays true to history and doesn''t let our view of Eaton be one-sided. He also shows, throughout the book, how Eaton''s various weaknesses work against him. One weakness is his inability to stay out of debt. Another is his inability to garner mutual respect with those in authority over him. \n\nBut the weakness that does him in is his inability to let go. Eaton''s mission ends, his obsession with Lear''s incompetent bungling and Jefferson''s complicity in undermining Eaton''s mission gnaw at him. He lets his unhappiness drive him to drink. And in 1811, he finally drinks himself into his grave at the age of 47. Five years later, Tobias Lear--Eaton''s most hated enemy--takes his own life. \n\nEaton''s mission was the first covert operation conducted overseas by the United States. He did not accomplish what he set out to do, because of undermining from other people--most notably Lear and Jefferson. But in the year following Eaton''s death, Stephen Decatur, Jr., commanded a Naval force that proceed to kick a-- and gravely weaken the pirate nations. \nDecatur''s actions stopped the Barbary Pirates from attacking US ships. But, those actions also emboldened other victim nations to fight back. \n\nIn 1829, two French brigates ran aground in the harbor in Algiers. The Dey (ruler) of Algiers had 109 officers and crew members beheaded. That action resulted in a massive French force descending upon Algiers. The French forced a surrender in three weeks, and took complete control of the country. France did not grant independence to Algiers until 1962, which is why French is a common language in Algiers even today. \n\nThe French also took control of Tunis in 1881, granting them independence in 1956. Tripoli did not come out of this unscathed. We are all familiar with this portion of The Marine Hymn: From the Halls of Montezuma to the Shores of Tripoli.

The teenage king of ancient Egypt is best-known by his golden death mask. But a fiberglass reconstruction of Tutankhamen based on computer models generated X-rays in 1969 of his mummified corpse bear little resemblance to the golden funeral mask found in the pharaoh''s tomb.

Scared yet? \n\nAuthor Kevin Phillips comes up with a series of characteristics of what he called a power already at its peak and starting to decline. The list includes a polarization of the society and widespread concern with cultural and economic decay; growing religious fervor and an increasingly close relationship between church and state; a rising commitment to faith over reason; growing government debt; and hubris-driven national strategic and military overreach. \n\nJeez, open most days'' newspaper and don''t be surprised to find concrete examples of each of these points. \n\nThe point risks being lost amid all the white noise predicting doom and gloom of different sorts these days.

While he there some validity in his conclusions, Mr. Phillips is no doubt oversimplifying an astonishingly complex set of issues. \n\nBut his ultimate conclusion -- that Republican extremists currently pulling the strings of power in Washington are responsible for the country''s energy vulnerability, over-stretched military, sky-high debt levels, and the indulgence of radical religion -- are a threat to the country as great as the one facing fifth-century Rome is rings true and is without a doubt bone chilling.

Some even openly call for the destruction of the west, and what''s worse Fallaci says, is that anyone who speaks out against this madness is ridiculed and threatened into submission. As much as the Muslims themselves, she blames the left-wing governments and media of Europe, who are unwittingly contributing to the death of western culture, all in the name of tolerance. Ms. Fallaci herself is a victim of many death threats, and has been virtually ostracized from the European community because of her outspoken views on Islam. From some of the other reviews I got the impression that this would be nothing but an ignorant, hate-filled diatribe, but I found it to be insightful, compelling, and even humorous. While I don''t agree with all of Fallaci''s views, I commend her for this courageous work.\n', '2006-02-28 00:00:00', 60);

Harr''s skillful and long-awaited follow-up to 1997''s A Civil Action provides a finely detailed account of the fuss. While contoured brush strokes and pentimenti repaints have little to do with the toxic waters and legalese Harr dissected in his debut, the author writes comfortably about complex artistic processes and enlivens the potentially tedious details of artistic restoration with his lively and articulate prose. Broken into short, succinct chapters, the narrative unfolds at a brisk pace, skipping quickly from the perspective of 91-year-old Caravaggio scholar Sir Denis Mahon to that of young, enterprising Francesca Cappelletti, a graduate student at the University of Rome researching the disappearance of The Taking of Christ. The mystery ends with Sergio Benedetti, a restorer at the National Gallery of Ireland, who ultimately discovers the lost, grime-covered masterpiece in a house owned by Jesuit priests. But while adept at coordinating dates and analyzing hairline fractures in aged paint, Harr often seems overly concerned with the step-by-step process of tracking down The Taking of the Christ, as if the specific artist who created it were irrelevant. Granted, Harr is not an art historian, but his lack of artistic analysis of Caravaggio''s paintings may frustrate readers who wish to know more about the naturalistic Italian''s works.', '2005-08-07 00:00:00', 3);

The Long Tail offers a fascinating glimpse of how technology could make mass markets smaller while niche markets expand. \n\nHow did we get here? Online music services and Internet bookstores, with their infinite virtual shelf space, can stock every product. Brick-and-mortar shops, with scarce space, must concentrate on hits. So it''s no mystery why certain Long Tail businesses - like digital music - have taken off. It''s a lot more tempting to choose from 3 million songs at iTunes starting at 99 cents, compared to choosing from 60,000 tracks at Wal-Mart starting at $12. \n\nThe question is, does this lead to more aggregate sales, or merely a shift from the head of the tail (the hits) to the Long Tail (the niches)? Are Internet retailers creating new demand, or simply taking share from old brick-and-mortar businesses? \n\nThe Long Tail does show how niche opportunities are popping up everywhere because the Internet has enabled low-cost (or no-cost) reach into those markets. According to Anderson, software-driven recommendations - like Amazon''s book suggestions or Netflix''s movie recommendations -- rival word-of-mouth: \n\nRecommendations have all the demand-generation power of advertising, but at virtually no cost. If Netflix suggests a film to you based on what it knows about your taste and what others thought of that film, it can be more influential than a generic billboard aimed at the broadest possible audience. \n\nThe main ideas in The Long Tail have been around for years, but Anderson puts it all into context beautifully. But he overreaches by implying that Long Tail economics applies everywhere. The discussion of digital music is convincing. No doubt, iPods and downloading has driven the Long Tail in music. The reasons are obvious: people prefer portable songs for 99 cents instead of paying $18 for a CD with one or two good songs. \n\nBut digital music is different from other products. Downloading a song for 99 cents is an impulse entertainment purchase. Does the Long Tail apply to books equally? Will students buy more textbooks simply because more titles are available? Will fiction readers buy more mysteries and discover new authors simply because a recommendation for them turns up on Amazon? \n\nAnderson declares blockbuster economics obsolete. But in the film and book worlds, the hits still rule. The Harry Potters and the Da Vinci Codes sell more every year. Isn''t it ironic that The Long Tail, a book about the death of hits, is a monster bestseller? The Internet hasn''t repealed the 80 / 20 rule yet. \n\nThese quibbles aside, I recommend The Long Tail.

INSERT INTO APP.EDITORIAL_REVIEW (OID, REVIEWER, REVIEW, ADDED_ON, BOOK_OID) VALUES (17, 'Danis Littrel', 'What I mean by scattered is that the book could use a sharper focus. Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Ron Suskind waded through mountains of documents and transcripts and notes from interviews and then published this as quickly as he could. He wanted to include all the important details he uncovered while they were topical, but he didn''t really have the time to properly meld them into the narrative. The result is the book is a little less readable and engaging than it might have been. \n\nNonetheless, this is a fascinating account of how the Bush administration operates. \n\nThe One Percent Doctrine that forms the centerpiece and focal point is from Vice President Dick Cheney. Here''s an example of how Cheney articulated it: If there''s a one percent chance that Pakistani scientists are helping Al Qaeda build or develop a nuclear weapon, we have to treat it as a certainty in terms of our response. Cheney added, It''s not about our analysis, or finding a preponderance of evidence... It''s about our response. (p. 62) \n\nLooked at carefully this doctrine is really just a rationale for the Bush administration to do what it wants to do. The key point is the one percent. If it''s not about...a preponderance of evidence, how do we know that there''s a one percent chance? How do we know that it''s not one tenth of one percent or one thousandth of one percent or a googleplex of one percent? We don''t. And that is exactly the point of the Cheney Doctrine. As Suskind puts it, A key feature of the Cheney Doctrine was to quietly liberate action from such accepted standards of proof... Suspicion...became the threshold for action. (p. 163) \n\nLooked at in terms of our invasion of Iraq, the utility of the Cheney Doctrine to the Bush administration becomes clear. Was there a one percent chance that Saddam Hussein was developing weapons of mass destruction? Psychologically, since WMD are so scary, the answer was yes. But as far as evidence goes, the answer was no. Suskind writes: ...Cheney''s doctrine was an audacious challenge to international legalities. Where once a discernible act of aggression against America or its national interest was the threshold for a US military response, now even proof of a threat is too constraining a standard. (p. 214) \n\nI just wish the Cheney Doctrine had been applied to such things as global warming or stem cell research. Is there a one percent chance that the US will fall woefully behind the rest of the world in developing disease prevention and cure because we will not fund stem cell research? Is there a one percent chance that global warming is caused by human activities? In terms of the invasion of Iraq, perhaps Cheney and Bush ought to have asked, is there a one percent chance that invading Iraq will increase jihadist recruitment and will turn world opinion so against the US that we will lose effectiveness in our ability to fight terrorism? \n\nIt could also be said that by the logic of the one percent doctrine we really ought to have invaded North Korea and Iran. \n\nAlthough Ron Suskind''s assault on the Bush administration is not frontal, make no mistake about it, this book is yet another indictment. Much of the barrage comes from the experience of professionals in the intelligence community, most particularly from the experience of George Tenet who was director of the CIA until Bush allowed him to resign in June of 2004. The main thrust of Suskind''s intent is to show that the Cheney Doctrine allowed the Bush administration to accept as a guiding principle...that suspicion was an adequate threshold for preventative action and thereby justify the invasion of Iraq. \n\nAlong the way, Suskind shows how the Bush administration also justified torture of detainees, how it lied to the American people and the world about the evidence for WMD in Iraq, how it made a phony connection between Saddam Hussein and Al Qaeda, and how in general secrecy and mendacity became hallmarks of the Bush administration. \n\nThere is a lot of insider knowledge in this book that could only have been gotten from people in the know whom Suskind does not identify. (Too bad.) He remarks in an Author''s Note toward the end of the book that he''d like to mention their names and offer public thanks, but--to a one--I think they''d rather I not. (p. 350) Clearly this is the strength of this book, the sort of horse''s mouth type of veracity that comes only from actually talking to those deep inside. \n\nOne point that I found particularly interesting is the evidence here that Al Qaeda was responsible for the anthrax mailings that killed several people shortly after 9/11. (See pages 70-72 and 251-252.) We have not been made aware of this apparently because the Bush administration considers such knowledge too scary for consumption by the general APP. \n\nI also appreciated Suskind''s statement that the neocons in the White House, led by Wolfowitz and Feith, thought that Saddam Hussein was an easy mark...a demonstration model to show the new resolve of the United States and its postmodern rules of international behavior (p. 214)--that is, to show that preemptive strikes were now policy, and aggressive wars might be in the offing from here on out. Actually this is the main reason for invading Iraq, that is, to flex new muscle and show the world that we will actually use our military strength. \n\nOne final observation from Suskind: Cheney''s nickname inside CIA was ''Edgar.'' As in Bergen. The President would, by implication, be in the Charlie McCarthy role [that is, in the role of the puppet]. This isn''t fair, but it is at least half true.

If one quotes the fees in these charts or budgets these figures with no adjustments, the fees in these charts will remain the same, year after year, ad infiniteum because the same figures will continue to be reported. In comparing figures from previous editions, many of these figures in these have remained exactly the same or even gone down for at least a decade. THE FEES WERE HIGHER IN 1991, TEN YEARS AGO Even in places where they have gone up, and if one considers inflationary adjustments, the scenario is even more negative. From 1991-2001, the inflationary adjustment based on the Bureau of Labor Statistics'' Consumer Price Index is 31%. To compare, if the price for the front cover of a paperback trade book, major distribution is suggested in the1991 edition to be $3000, and in the 2001 edition the range of fees reported is $1500- $3000, something is wrong. That inflation adjusted fee of $3000 in 1991 would be almost $4000 today. The scenario is no better in other areas like advertising, corporate, and magazine editiorial. If a freelancer does 2 dozen jobs like this a year, at the stagnated fee, if would mean a $24,000 loss of income compared to 1991. That loss is even higher when you factor in capital expenditures in technology-computers, printers, scanners, websites--which didn''t exist before. I am not saying that this book is to blame for declining or stagnating prices. the reasons for that are many and complicated: wild discounting by stock houses, and increased competition caused by easy access to national/international markets, increased pressure on copyright usage caused by globalization, electronic uses and corporate conglomerates, to name a few. But freelancers using the reported fees in this book for quoting and accepting fees won''t even maintain the status quo ad infiniteum, to the delight of client business mangagers.\n', '1998-07-08 00:00:00', 23);

If part two covers less traumatic events, it''s also more subtle and, in some ways, more moving. Sent by her liberal, intellectual parents from Tehran to Vienna to get an education and escape the religious police, rebellious but vulnerable teenage Satrapi learns about secular freedom''s pitfalls. Struggling in school, falling in with misfits and without a support group, she ends up dealing drugs for a boyfriend and eventually finds herself homeless on the streets. Forced to return to Iran, Satrapi must once again take up the veil, but learns to live within the constraints of her native land, which border on the surreal. For instance, while Satrapi''s racing to catch a bus, the religious police tell her to stop running so her bottom doesn''t make obscene movements. Well, then, don''t look at my ass! she angrily responds. The book''s cornerstone is her relationship with her parents, who seem to have enough faith in her to let her make the wrong decisions, as when she marries an egotistical artist. Satrapi''s art is deceptively simple: it''s capable of expressing a wide range of emotion and capturing subtle characterization with the bend of a line.

However, when I saw that the author was Steve McConnell, the author of Code Complete (which I thought was a great book) I knew that this book would have something to offer. \n\nHis definition of the purpose of software estimation is important: The primary purpose of software estimation is not to predict a project''s outcome; it is to determine whether a project''s targets are realistic enough to allow the project to be controlled to meet them. \n\nFrom this premise, the author continues to prove that software estimation is about determining if you can control a project to bring it in reasonably close to the organization''s targets. In addition to this, Mr. McConnell''s arguments for overestimation being better than underestimation are rather good and have convinced me to continue using my risk time and budget items that I''ve been using and recommending to others. \n\n\nIn chapter 4, the author identifies four main sources of project estimation errors: \n\n-Inaccurate information about the project being estimated \n-Inaccurate information about the capabilities of the organization that will perform the project \n-Too much chaos in the project to support accurate estimation (that is, trying to estimate a moving target) \n-Inaccuracies arising from the estimation process itself \n\n\nThat last one presents the need for me to give a little more information. The author suggests that bias and subjectivity of the estimator cause major estimation errors in the estimation process. This is proven through exercise case studies of time estimation in training classes. The author found that the more control knobs (impacting factors considered when estimating the project) used in the estimation process the greater the probability of variance in the estimates. He attributes this to bias and estimator subjectivity and it makes a lot of sense. \n\nIn the end, this book will make you a better estimator and project manager and I highly recommend it. \n', '2006-06-24 00:00:00', 32);

CSS has been around for awhile now, but only recently has the most current browsers been able to support the cool stuff you can do with it. What cool stuff? You need to buy the book to find out, but I''ll give you some highlights... \n\nFirst off, the first chapter explains how to use document types, divs and spans, validation, basics of CSS (selectors, pseudo-classes, child and sibling selectors, attribute selectors, etc), how cascade and specifity works, and how to organize your style sheets. A great primer to the rest of the book. \n\nThe 2nd chapter focuses visual formatting with CSS with the Box Model, Positioning and Floating. This is an important topic because creating CSS layouts requires a good understanding of how these topics work (and work together) in creating real-world layouts. \n\nChapter 3 talks about using background images and replacement in creating rounded corner effects, drop shadows (4 different kinds), and some cool image replacement for optimizing search engines and screen readers (accessibility). \n\nChapter 4 has some great examples on styling links to create efficient CSS buttons without the images or the JavaScript for the roll-over effect. Yes, CSS can create some cool buttons without you ever having to use Photoshop. :) \n\nChapter 5 continues with styling links but extends it in showing you how to create button nav bars (horizontal and vertical) and adds a few tricks with using some image placeholders and sections to create some nice looking professional navigation for your website. \n\nChapter 6 focuses on the right way to use tables: for displaying data (not layout for web sites - no more nested tables). With the use of the very popular border-collapse property and others, Andy shows some very eye-please table layouts. \n\nChapter 7 in my opinion is the meat-and-potatoes of the book. Its goes over some how to use CSS in creating some standardized layouts. The whole point of CSS is to separate your content and layout and this is the way to go. It is explained in a very easy to follow manner with plenty of screenshots to show you each step. \n\nThe rest of the book (Chapter 8 and Chapter 9) review the common and not-so-common CSS hacks that are used to overcome some browser deficiencies. I can''t tell you how many website I had to search to find out about these, and its all here in these 2 chapters!. \n\nThe last part of the book has 2 Case Studies that show how a website created purely with CSS was created from beginning to end.

Holmes (born Herman Webster Mudgett) dispatched somewhere between 27 and 200 people, mostly single young women, in the churning new metropolis of Chicago; many of the murders occurred during (and exploited) the city''s finest moment, the World''s Fair of 1893. Larson''s breathtaking new history is a novelistic yet wholly factual account of the fair and the mass murderer who lurked within it. Bestselling author Larson (Isaac''s Storm) strikes a fine balance between the planning and execution of the vast fair and Holmes''s relentless, ghastly activities. The passages about Holmes are compelling and aptly claustrophobic; readers will be glad for the frequent escapes to the relative sanity of Holmes''s co-star, architect and fair overseer Daniel Hudson Burnham, who managed the thousands of workers and engineers who pulled the sprawling fair together 0n an astonishingly tight two-year schedule. A natural charlatan, Holmes exploited the inability of authorities to coordinate, creating a small commercial empire entirely on unpaid debts and constructing a personal cadaver-disposal system.

Byatt and Alexander McCall Smith, among many others. The first three books in the series -- fictions by Margaret Atwood and Jeanette Winterson and an introductory volume by Karen Armstrong -- have recently appeared in 28 languages from 33 publishers (there are five English language editions) in the biggest simultaneous publication ever.\nIt''s difficult not to recast this achievement in pop-culture terms -- Monster Mythology Smackdown! -- and just as difficult not to add one''s own mythic subtext, that of David and Goliath. Canongate was established in 1973, a small Edinburgh publisher specializing in Scottish titles such as Escape From Loch Leven and Scottish Love Poems. Still, even in its early years, Canongate showed a taste for the offbeat, publishing the Glaswegian author Alasdair Gray and the first UK edition of Edward Abbey''s seminal The Monkey Wrench Gang. But by the early 1990s, the foundering house was in receivership.\n\nEnter Jamie Byng. The youngest son of the Earl of Stafford and the stepson of a former chairman of the BBC, Byng studied literature at Edinburgh University and worked as a publicist at Canongate when he was 24. In 1994, at the ripe old age of 26, he masterminded a buyout of the company. Byng has since transformed Canongate from the publisher of Traditional Scottish Dyes and How To Make Them into a powerhouse, 2003''s British Book Awards Publisher of the Year. He''s done this through a winning combination of prescience, irreverence and boldness. For instance, in 1998 he started releasing inexpensive paperbacks of the books of the Bible under the series title Pocket Canons, each introduced by a different author: Fay Weldon on Corinthians, Bono on the Psalms, Ruth Rendell on Romans and Will Self on Revelations.\n\nIn 2002, Canongate published Michel Faber''s bestselling The Crimson Petal and the White; the previous year, Byng bought the British rights to Yann Martel''s Life Of Pi. Martel''s novel subsequently won the Man Booker Prize, cementing Byng''s reputation as a visionary maverick. It also, presumably, lined Canongate''s coffers so that Byng could begin publishing The Myths.\n\nWhich brings us to the books themselves. These are novellas rather than full-blown novels, but Jeanette Winterson''s contribution in particular feels wispy, despite its title. Weight is a retelling of the myth of Atlas. As Winterson puts it in her introduction, I have written this personal story in the First Person . . . and this leads to questions of autobiography. Autobiography is not important. Authenticity is important. The writer must fire herself through the text, be the molten stuff that welds together disparate elements. I believe there is always exposure, vulnerability, in the writing process, which is not to say it is either confessional or memoir. Simply, it is real.\n\nUnfortunately, Weight doesn''t make good on this promise (or threat) of authorial alchemy. Despite narrative shifts from first- and third-person, and among Atlas, Heracles and the author, Weight is a fairly straightforward account of one of the 12 labors of Heracles. Atlas was born one of the Titans, half man, half god, a giant of a giant race.\n\nPunished by the Olympian gods for rebelling against them, he is sentenced to carry the Kosmos upon his back. Heracles has also fallen afoul of the gods, but through an accident of birth. He is Zeus''s son by a mortal woman, and has long suffered the enmity of Zeus''s wife, Hera. Hera first maddens Heracles so that he slays his own children, then helps engineer the Labors as atonement for his crime. His penultimate task is to obtain the Golden Apples from the Garden of the Hesperides (Atlas''s daughters), guarded by the hundred-headed serpent Ladon. Heracles offers to hold up the Kosmos while Atlas obtains the fruit for him. Atlas very sensibly decides to leave Heracles with the weight, but Heracles tricks Atlas into taking the world back onto his shoulders.\n\nIt''s a poignant story -- who doesn''t sympathize with Atlas, especially when he''s contrasted with the bullying, bragging Heracles? -- but despite occasional glints of humor, Weight is a leaden retelling of it. Only in its last pages does Winterson''s book finally soar, when she introduces Atlas to Laika, the Russian dog sent into space in 1957. Atlas had long ago ceased to feel the weight of the world he carried, but he felt the skin and bone of this little dog. Now he was carrying something he wanted to keep, and that changed everything. In this brief, sweet sequence, we glimpse a new myth being born. I want to tell the story again, Winterson repeats at the end of Weight. Her account of Atlas and Laika made me wish she would.\n\nMargaret Atwood''s distaff take on The Odyssey -- The Penelopiad -- is more successful, if not terribly surprising. A feminist perspective on Homer from Margaret Atwood? We''re shocked. Penelope has for eons been the poster girl for feminine fidelity. Intelligent, yes, but also rather dull, and slightly maddening by 21st-century standards -- she waited how long? For him? While he was sleeping with them? Atwood doesn''t exactly give her a makeover, but she gives her a voice, at once plaintive and wise, as well as a long view: Penelope narrates her tale from the gloomy halls of Hades.\n\nWell, yes, it is dark, but there are advantages -- for instance, if you see someone you''d rather not speak to you can always pretend you haven''t recognised them.\n\nThe events dovetail with those in The Odyssey; the narrative shifts are in emphasis more than execution. So we get Penelope''s curt commentary on her beautiful cousin Helen, as well as her clear-eyed assessment of marriage:\n\nMarriages were for having children, and children were not toys and pets. Children were vehicles for passing things along. These things could be kingdoms, rich wedding gifts, stories, grudges, blood feuds. . . . To have a child was to set loose a force in the world.\n\nWe also see Penelope''s grief, well-salted with guilt, for the 12 serving maidens who were slain upon her husband''s return home. In The Odyssey, the maids are hanged by Telemachus, son of Odysseus and Penelope, for the crime of sleeping with the suitors who had taken up residence in Odysseus''s halls. Atwood makes them a loopily postmodern Greek chorus, with mixed results. Penelope''s story is strong stuff: Introducing chapters with titles such as The Chorus Line: Kiddie Mourn, A Lament by the Maids gives these sections the air of a failed Monty Python sketch.\n\nFinally, Karen Armstrong provides A Short History of Myth, an introductory volume to Canongate''s series. Armstrong is the bestselling author of A History of God, Islam: A Short History and Buddha, among other titles. Her essay here is serviceable. She relies heavily on the usual suspects -- Mircea Eliade, Joseph Campbell, Walter Burkert -- and has a lamentable tendency to make sweeping pronouncements that sound trite: In the pre-modern world, mythology was indispensable. . . . It was an early form of psychology. People were becoming disillusioned with the old mythical vision that had nourished their ancestors. The Neanderthal graves show that when these early people became conscious of their mortality, they created some sort of counter-narrative that enabled them to come to terms with it.\n\nPerhaps in future volumes Canongate could give equal time to scholars such as Jack Zipes and Marina Warner, and historians like Italy''s Carlo Ginzburg or South Africa''s David Lewis-Williams, whose work has more provocatively explored the boundaries and evolution of myths and storytelling.\n\nStill, these first three books are a tantalizing start to an ambitious project, with intriguing works to come: Israeli author David Grossman''s version of Samson, the Russian Victor Pelevin''s Theseus and the American Donna Tartt''s take on Daedalus and Icarus. All mythology is a work-in-progress. New myths are being born right now, and old ones reinvented, in decaying buildings, on laptop computers, in hushed rooms around the globe. Canongate is to be applauded for serving as midwife to some of them.\n\n', '2006-03-22 00:00:00', 40);

Former military cop Reacher does his level best not to come back: he lives off the grid (no address, no belongings), but his instincts keep driving him toward solving other people''s problems, the kind that won''t stay solved without violence.

INSERT INTO APP.EDITORIAL_REVIEW (OID, REVIEWER, REVIEW, ADDED_ON, BOOK_OID) VALUES (56, 'Christine Rosen ', 'Few political strategists have relied so extensively on history to understand the American political system as Kevin Phillips. Often identified as a former Republican strategist, Phillips has made a career of charting his disillusion with the GOP in books such as American Dynasty, a blistering look at the Bush family. His latest, American Theocracy, continues this scrutiny -- with mixed results.\nAmerican Theocracy is three books in one. He argues that a reckless dependency on shrinking oil supplies, a milieu of radicalized (and much too influential) religion, and a reliance on borrowed money . . . now constitute the three major perils to the United States of the twenty-first century. \n\nHis first worry is oil. Over the last several hundred years each leading global economic power has ridden an emergent fuel resource into the pages of history, he notes, citing Britain''s 19th-century reliance on the coal industry as an example. But such reliance can prove disastrous if that resource dries up, which Phillips believes will happen. Citing the more pessimistic of geologists'' projections about declining global oil reserves, he argues that our dependence on oil has ushered in an era of petro-imperialism that spawned the war in Iraq. \n\nPhillips is equally pessimistic about the emergence of a debt and credit-industrial complex that endangers the U.S. economy''s foundations. Historically, he writes, dominance of an economy by the financial-services industry, as has now taken place in the United States, has been a sign of late-stage debilitation, marked by excessive debt, great disparity between rich and poor, and unfolding economic decline. He''s clear on who''s to blame: the supposedly conservative Republican Party, which, rather than governing in a fiscally responsible manner, has compromised the country''s future out of both ignorance of history and a classic onset of greed. \n\nBut as the book''s title suggests, it is the religious right that most occupies Phillips. He is not subtle in his descriptions of this group: The rapture, end-times, and Armageddon hucksters in the United States rank with any Shiite ayatollahs. The GOP has been transformed into the first religious party in U.S. history, Phillips argues, and it is ushering in an American Disenlightenment that rejects the separation of church and state and ignores the teachings of science. \n\nMuch of Phillips''s focus is on the eschatology of evangelical, fundamentalist and Pentecostal Christians, including their understanding of the prophecies in the New Testament book of Revelation that describe the events leading to the world''s end, events that some evangelicals believe may be foreshadowed by today''s turmoil in the Middle East. Conservative politicians understood that for true believers their imminent rapture and the subsequent second coming of Jesus Christ were the only endgame, Phillips argues. We can estimate that for 20 to 30 percent of Christians, this chronology superseded or muted other issues, such as economic self-interest and the absence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. But Phillips provides no source for this estimate. He also asserts, rather than proves, that such ideas animate the Bush administration -- worrying, for example, about White House implementation of domestic and international political agendas that seem to be driven by religious motivations and biblical worldviews. \n\nThis seems due in part to the low opinion Phillips has of born-again Christians, whom he sees as victims of a form of religious false consciousness. He argues that Some 30 to 40 percent of the Bush electorate, many of whom might otherwise resent their employment conditions, credit-card debt, heating bills, or escalating costs of automobile upkeep . . . often subordinate these economic concerns to a broader religious preoccupation with biblical prophecy and the second coming of Jesus Christ. \n\nBut contrary to Phillips''s claims, speculation about the doomsday-era end times -- which has been present among certain segments of America''s Christian population for more than a century -- does not necessarily lead to the embrace of apocalyptic economic or foreign policy goals. It does not even guarantee sustained support for war; the percentage of white evangelical Christians who back the war in Iraq has dropped from 87 in 2003 to 68 in January 2006, according to Charles Marsh, an evangelical professor of religion at the University of Virginia. To suggest, as Phillips does, that the Bush administration, at the behest of born-again Christians, is intent on launching international warfare to spread the gospel is astonishingly simplistic. \n\nThis tendency for overstatement stems in part from Phillips''s reliance on questionable sources, including partisan radio networks such as Air America and books (such as Esther Kaplan''s With God on Their Side: How Christian Fundamentalists Trampled Science, Policy, and Democracy in George W. Bush''s White House) that are far from balanced. He also cites statements by self-appointed evangelical spokesmen like Jerry Falwell as evidence of the religious right''s extreme views. But a survey conducted last year by the PBS program Religion & Ethics NewsWeekly found that most evangelicals themselves view Falwell unfavorably. Phillips is more successful with his summaries of religious history, where he relies on the work of well-regarded scholars such as Mark Noll of Wheaton College and George Marsden of Notre Dame. \n\nYet even Phillips must admit that in terms of concrete policies, the so-called theocracy he describes has been surprisingly ineffective at turning its agenda into law. As of this writing, he concedes, none of the half-dozen pieces of quasi-theocratic legislation drafted by the religious right . . . had achieved passage, but the time could come. In fact, according to the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, white evangelicals'' electoral influence is not on the rise; they constituted only 23 percent of the electorate in both 2000 and 2004. And the percentage of Bush voters who are white evangelicals remained constant at 36 percent in 2000 and 2004; as the Pew Center noted, Bush in 2004 made relatively bigger gains among infrequent churchgoers than he did among religiously observant voters. \n\nStill, Phillips sees the religious right''s influence on nearly every major decision the Bush administration has made. He pins the invasion of Iraq not on the influence of advisers such as Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld but on the power of the tens of millions of true believers viewing events through a Left Behind perspective. Whether discussing oil, the economy or American faith, when Phillips abandons his thoughtful explorations of history for the present, he produces polemics ill-suited to his talents -- seemingly written for an audience that wants its prejudices reaffirmed rather than examined. Years from now, historians studying the early 21st century will be able to judge how many of Phillips''s dire predictions proved prescient. Lately, even the Bush administration has given lip service to the idea that the country needs to reduce its dependence on foreign oil. But in his disillusionment with the GOP, Phillips has allowed intemperance to infect his analysis. As a result, what could have been a thoughtful critique has become yet another book that caters to partisan passions.\n\n', '2006-09-02 00:00:00', 56);
INSERT INTO APP.EDITORIAL_REVIEW (OID, REVIEWER, REVIEW, ADDED_ON, BOOK_OID) VALUES (57, 'Robin Orlowski ', 'In his introduction to Madeleine Albright''s surprising new book on religion and foreign policy, Bill Clinton writes that his former secretary of state chose her subject against the advice of friends. Those friends are left unnamed, but they surely include colleagues who helped Albright craft U.S. foreign policy in the Clinton years -- and maybe even President Clinton himself. The cause of their trepidation must have related to the most important -- and bravest -- point that Albright makes here: that on her watch, U.S. foreign policy made every effort to ignore religion.\nTo a new generation of foreign policy thinkers who must now deal with jihadist terrorism, it seems absurd that America''s leaders self-consciously pretended that religion was not an important world force. But according to Albright -- and it is hard to see why she would overstate the case -- the Clinton team insisted privately, not just publicly, that the Balkan crises, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and, yes, al-Qaeda''s August 1998 bombing of two U.S. embassies in East Africa were not about religion. \n\nGiven that the participants in all these events said that their conflicts were precisely about religion, it is worth wondering how our best and brightest could have remained so obstinately in denial. The cause, according to Albright, was the legacy of foreign policy realism -- the view that nations'' actions could be predicted by assuming that they would rationally pursue their own interests. This theory, which is almost exclusively secular, taught diplomats to ignore religious rhetoric and zeal and to look instead for familiar, interest-based motives. Albright, with the help of her longtime speechwriter Bill Woodward, argues that the realist approach must be amended by inserting an awareness of the increasingly significant role that religion plays in the making of individual and national decisions, not just abroad but here in the United States as well. The result is a book that makes an important contribution to the question of how our foreign policy should adjust to the rise of religion worldwide.\n\nAlbright''s reckoning with her own policy legacy amounts to a particularly candid first draft of history. She''s right that foreign policy realism did, in a certain sense, downplay the religious interests of nations, but she does not acknowledge the main reason that realism let her down in confronting the principal diplomatic crises of the 1990s. Put simply, realism is a theory about the behavior of states. Yet the most important foreign policy challenges of the Clinton years came not from states but from nonstate actors such as Osama bin Laden''s terrorist network and the militias in failed or failing states such as Somalia. Even Yasser Arafat, whose intransigence at the summer 2000 Israeli-Palestinian summit at Camp David cost Albright and Clinton a permanent place in diplomatic history, was not the head of a proper state.\n\nThis matters a lot. Leaders without states have very different incentives than do presidents and kings. Although dictators and democrats do not always behave the same way, any government -- admirable or nasty -- needs to deliver basic security and services in order to maintain its authority. That is why the behavior of presidents (for life or otherwise) can often be predicted by asking what actions would best serve the interests of the state in question.\n\nThe same is not true of guerrillas, freedom fighters or terrorists, who may be chasing dreams of world-transformation. Without a body of citizens for whose well-being they are in some way responsible, nonstate leaders are free to act according to ideals that may well clash with practical reality -- and some of those ideals will be religious ones. Albright is therefore right to call for enhancing religious expertise in the State Department, but we also need to pay much more attention to the ways that U.S. foreign policy engages not just governments but groups and movements made up of ordinary people who are moved by the full range of human beliefs and emotions.\n\nOf course, religion''s role in foreign policy does not stop at the water''s edge. In our own democracy, citizens'' religious commitments often play a major role in shaping their preferences about how the United States should engage the world. It would be hard to explain, for example, America''s close relationship to Israel without at least some reference to the strong connection to the Holy Land felt by many Christians and Jews. \n\nWhen it comes to the effect of religion on U.S. policies, Albright takes a somewhat complicated stand. She is eager to make common cause with evangelicals who care deeply about humanitarian issues in order to create an international genocide-prevention force under U.N. auspices. (How many evangelicals would agree to this plan is left unexamined.) She studiously avoids criticizing the Bush administration''s foreign policy as religiously inspired, though she quotes others who accuse the White House of being theologically presumptuous and dangerously messianic. And she accepts that religion must be taken into account by leaders who, like the rest of us, are inevitably influenced by their faith when they choose a course of action. \n\nAt the same time, Albright espouses a skeptical theology according to which we should tolerate other people''s religious views because they might turn out to be right, after all. As a proof text for this approach, she quotes Clinton himself: It is OK to say you believe your religion is true, even truer than other faiths, but not that you are in possession in this life of a hundred percent of the truth. This cautious doctrine is appealing -- even characteristically American. But it is by no means shared by all people of faith, many of whom believe the Bible or the Koran contains the whole truth. In a democracy, the votes of the true believers weigh just as heavily as the votes of the skeptics. To welcome religion into the making of our foreign policy is to acknowledge that certainties, not just well-meant aspirations, are going to play their part.\n\nThe painful truth about democracy is that the policies we make will generally be the product of compromise, not reasoned judgment. Realism sought to solve this problem by teaching diplomats to ignore ideals and focus on long-term interests. Today, our moral compass tells us that realism without values is not enough. But once we open the door to values, we cannot be sure that our policies will be coherent enough to succeed. \n', '2006-05-30 00:00:00', 57);

A swarming menace called radical Islam, he writes, rings Europe''s cities in smoldering Muslim ghettos, provoking everything from so-called honor killings and political assassinations to the Madrid subway bombings and the massacre of school children in Beslan. Worse, the Taliban-like theocracy Bawer sees looming inside backward immigrant populations resistant to integration flourishes under the protective wing of Western Europe''s America-bashing, multicultural, liberal establishment.

One are the Islamists who divide humanity into two groups: the People of Paradise and the People of Hell. And who insist that their beliefs alone are off-limits when it comes to critical inquiry. The second group is the multiculturalists and relativists, who do not find anything particular valuable in Western Culture over any other culture (including those who kill a daughter who has been raped to preserve honor.) \n\nSo who WILL like this book? Those who do deeply cherish Western culture as it has developed through the US constitution, who value the hard won freedom and autonomy of the individual, who believe that women are the equals of men and should be treated as so, and those who believe that humanity reaches its greatest heights when the human mind is left free. \n\nMake no mistake about it. Fallaci really really hates (my word) what is happening to her culture (an ongoing surrender to an immigrating, limiting Islam), because she really loves what Western Culture (via Locke and others) has been. And that passion comes in like a great blazing fireball. She is a real and authentic voice, with ragged edges, authenticity, fire, and conviction. The multiculturalists, pacifists, Islamists and others are doing everything they can to shut her up. But it seems that the strength of her fire only grows. The West is so lucky to have a woman like her. We need a thousand such voices, and even more. We need the passionate understanding of how wonderful our own culture is, and how it is worth preserving and fighting for. Read this book with While Europe Slept and you''ll get a real education. \n\nFallaci''s The Force of Reason is a raw act of courage. And Fallaci is a great hero of our time. My heartfelt thanks and gratitude to her for the gift of her passion, as rare as diamonds and as precious as gold in a culture becoming as limp as milque toast. ', '2006-02-15 00:00:00', 60);
